    <h1>General Terms and Conditions</h1>

    <h2>1. Scope</h2>
    <p>These General Terms and Conditions (GTC) apply to all orders placed by consumers and entrepreneurs via our online shop on the website <a href="">www.lifeplustest.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>2. Contractual Partner</h2>
    <p>The purchase contract is concluded with Life+ LLC, 123 Innovation Street, San Francisco, CA 94107, USA. You can reach our customer service for questions, complaints, and claims on weekdays from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM at the phone number +1 415-555-1234 or by email at <a href="">info@lifeplus.com</a>.</p>

    <h2>3. Conclusion of Contract</h2>
    <p>The presentation of products in our online shop does not constitute a legally binding offer but rather an invitation to place an order. By clicking the "Order Now" button, you submit a binding order for the goods in your shopping cart. The confirmation of receipt of the order follows immediately after the order is sent and does not yet constitute acceptance of the contract. We can accept your order by sending an order confirmation via email or by delivering the goods within five days.</p>

    <h2>4. Prices and Shipping Costs</h2>
    <p>The prices stated on the product pages include statutory VAT and other price components. In addition to the stated prices, shipping costs may apply, which will be clearly communicated to you before the order is finalized.</p>

    <h2>5. Payment</h2>
    <p>Payment can be made via credit card, PayPal, or other payment methods as specified in the online shop. We reserve the right to exclude certain payment methods in individual cases.</p>

    <h2>6. Delivery</h2>
    <p>Unless otherwise agreed, delivery is made to the delivery address specified by you. The delivery period is approximately 3-7 business days, depending on the destination. We are not responsible for any delays caused by customs or other regulatory requirements.</p>

    <h2>7. Retention of Title</h2>
    <p>The goods remain our property until full payment is made.</p>

    <h2>8. Warranty</h2>
    <p>The statutory warranty rights apply. If the delivered goods have obvious material or manufacturing defects, including damage caused during transport, please report such defects to us or the carrier immediately.</p>

    <h2>9. Liability</h2>
    <p>We are liable without limitation for intent and gross negligence. In the case of slight negligence, we are liable only for breach of a material contractual obligation (an obligation whose fulfillment is essential for the proper execution of the contract and on whose compliance the contractual partner may regularly rely). In this case, liability is limited to the foreseeable, typically occurring damage.</p>

    <h2>10. Final Provisions</h2>
    <p>If any provision of these GTC is invalid, the remainder of the contract remains valid. The relevant statutory provisions shall apply in place of the invalid provision.</p>

    <p>The law of the United States applies, with the exclusion of the UN Sales Convention. For consumers, this choice of law only applies to the extent that the protection afforded by mandatory provisions of the law of the state in which the consumer has his or her habitual residence is not withdrawn.</p>
